# PCH App

![GitHub Logo](/client/src/assets/images/PCH_white.png)

## Overview

- PCH is a Real Estate and Mortgage Website, as well as Dashboard for team. It is built with React and Redux for the Front-end, using Material UI's Berry admin template.

- Backstory...I was helping my aunt with her website, which was hosted on a website platform specifically for lenders. It allowed her to manage her website, select from pre-existing design templates. It also had built in calculators, forms, and content structure specifically for the mortgage industry, such as rates, and tools. She also had access to a dashboard to view and manage leads from the website, as well as rates she had posted, plus a few other resources. The only downside was it had very limited customization functionality and not very user-friendly website builder. There was an option to add HTML/CSS...but that wasn't friendly looking either. THe main thing is, she is also a Real Estate agent and broker. This website is designed only for the mortgage side of things, so she couldn't add her property listings to be all in one place. Anyways, I was motivated to build a platform that suited her business needs!
